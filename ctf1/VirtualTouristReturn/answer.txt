Flag is cs628a{ff016c6bd760e18ef9e759340f94e110}. It has buffer overflow exploit. I 
overflowed with yes+chr(0x0)+string so that coparison with yes is true. In the overflow I 
had written address of data segment of just 4 bytes above it where I overflowed to write 
address of function _ZN5Flage8get_flagEPKc. Then it asked for input ffile, for which I gave 
flag.txt. This gave me the flag. Script.py is the file I used for attack.
